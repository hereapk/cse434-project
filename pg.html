				<h4 style=color:blue;>	ARTS Eastern University started in summer 2003 with four Faculties. The Faculty of Arts is one of them. It began its journey with M.A.ELT (English Language Teaching) program, and one semester later B.A (Hons.) in English was added. There are now three programs in the Faculty: a four year B.A. (Hons.) in English, a one-year M.A. ELL (English Language and Literature) and an M. A. ELT which offers a one-year M.A.ELT and a two-year M.A. ELT.

 	
A well earned degree in English can open innumerable job opportunities at home and abroad. English is an international language and there is a great demand for competent users of the language. Graduates in English get preference in jobs ranging from teaching to media, banks, multi national companies etc. English graduates do quite well at the BCS Examinations and find it helpful to pursue MBA studies, both  academically and job wise, as this combination is best for top corporate jobs.

 	 
 	
The English Program at Eastern follows a needs-based multi syllabus approach combining well-balanced language and literature courses in order to cater to the job needs of its graduates. Besides the foundation language courses at the undergraduate level are module-based, providing an intensive teaching-learning class environment. The Department has an English Language Club and holds extra class room activities such as poetry recitation, debate, drama, vocabulary/spelling contests to inspire and encourage learners to become adept users of the language.

 	 
 	
The English Department has as its Advisor Professor Kashinath Roy, who has taught English at Dhaka University for about four decades. Supporting him there are 20 highly qualified and highly motivated full-time teachers some of whom have degrees and training from abroad. In addition some very senior and nationally renowned academics from Dhaka University and  Jahangirnagar University are present as adjunct faculty. One very positive aspect of the Department is that Professor Dr. Nurul Islam (Ph.D. UK, Fulbright Fellow, Mechigan State University, USA) and presently the Vice-Chancellor of the University is the founder Chairman of the Department.
